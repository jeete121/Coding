/*
Attempts to build and insert an element into the %set.

Parameters:
__args â€“ Arguments used to generate an element.

Returns:
A pair, of which the first element is an iterator that points to the possibly inserted element, and the second is a bool that is true if the element was actually inserted. This function attempts to build and insert an element into the %set. A %set relies on unique keys and thus an element is only inserted if it is not already present in the %set. Insertion requires logarithmic time.
