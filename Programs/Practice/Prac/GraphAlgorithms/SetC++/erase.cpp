/*
Erases elements according to the provided key.

Parameters:
__x â€“ Key of element to be erased.

Returns:
The number of elements erased. This function erases all the elements
 located by the given key from a %set. Note that this function only
  erases the element, and that if the element is itself a pointer, 
  the pointed-to memory is not touched in any way. Managing the pointer 
  is the user's responsibility.
