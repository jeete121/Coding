It is known for its platform independence, meaning that Java programs can run on any device or operating system that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed. Java is widely used for developing a variety of applications, including desktop software, mobile apps, web applications, and enterprise systems. It has a large and active community of developers and is known for its robustness, security, and scalability."
